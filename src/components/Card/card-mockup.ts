    The project creates an audiovisual narrative of four episodes witnessed by water, from the moment of creation to current times, through the creation of aural images, non-verbal poeticness, and authorial music compositions that are combined to invoke powerful metaphors. the composed musical patterns based on modal and rhythmic figures in Persian music repertoire serve as vehicles for expressing senses and representing meanings. the images, poetics and visual metaphors, usually applied in the visual arts and literature, are used to deepen the metaphors invoked musically, helping to conduct the audience in their experience of different feelings and in exercising their dynamic imagination`,
